# Wari TF2 Configuration
This is a collection of my configuration files for TF2, there are a few areas with more involved scripts

## Autoexec.cfg
- Video and audio optimizations: Turns off phong, rimlighting, and and snd_mixahead (lower audio latency)
- Net settings: Interp, update rate, etc
- Custom settings: Crosshair type, color, viewmodel options, hitsound settings, etc
- Null movement script: Prevents two opposing movement keys being pressed from cancelling eachother out
## Medic.cfg
- Fake ubercalling by holding shift and pressing M2
- Reverse auto-fire medigun (Always acting as if M1 is held down, detaches when M1 is pressed)
- Loadout switch binds
## 0clear.cfg
- Complete (enough) set of default binds
## 0regen.cfg
- Practice script, binds M1 to regen
## Hitsounds
- Quake damage and kill sounds
## HUD Edits
- Place damage numbers onto the HUD
- Edit for longer tournament mode team names
